Lastly, if the user enters "Y" the program will print out "Good Job!" and the next date that the user needs to complete the habit again. If the user enters "N", then the program will print out "Make sure that you get back on track" and the next date that the user needs to complete the habit again. Lastly, by entering "Q" the user will be able to quit the program. The general input is the user's keyboard. The general processing that occurs is reading strings and integers from the user, while and for loops, if and else statements, and defining variables. The general output is the user's screen.
